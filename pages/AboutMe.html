          <p>
            I am Nima Ecija y Fernández. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I'm a student at SintLucas Eindhoven and am currently
            following a course Software Development.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            From a young age, I was interested in the working of a computer and started building them and playing with them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I built my first PC when I was about 12 years old and it was an amazing feeling when it was done.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Also played the piano for 12 years but stopped with my lessons because I wanted to do my own thing.
            I got interested in other instruments but haven't had much time to practice on them yet.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As a Software Developer in training, I always want to learn more about the topic.
            I have worked with HTML/CSS with sometimes Bootstrap and a bit of JavaScript and have also worked with C#.
            but at the moment, HTML/CSS are my strongest points.
